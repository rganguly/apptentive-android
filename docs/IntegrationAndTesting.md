            </intent-filter>
        </receiver>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

**Note:** Be sure to input your Apptentive API Key where it says `YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE`.

# Integrate your Activities with Apptentive

In order to keep track of Application state, we need to hook into the lifecycle of each Activity defined in your app.
There are two ways of doing this: *Inheritance* and *Delegation*. Inheritance is the easiest method, while delegation is
provided if you can't or don't want to inherit from our Activities.

Integrate ALL of the Activities in your app with [ApptentiveActivity](http://www.apptentive.com/docs/android/api/index.html?com/apptentive/android/sdk/ApptentiveActivity.html).
You can mix and match, but make sure they all integrate in one of the following two ways.

1. **Inheritance**

    ```java
    import com.apptentive.android.sdk.ApptentiveActivity;

    public class ExampleActivity extends ApptentiveActivity {
    ```

2. **Delegation**

    ```java
    import com.apptentive.android.sdk.ApptentiveActivity;

    ...

    @Override
    protected void onStart() {
        super.onStart();
        Apptentive.onStart(this);
    }

    @Override
    protected void onStop() {
        super.onStop();
        Apptentive.onStop(this);
    }
```

# Message Center

The [Message Center](https://github.com/skykelsey/apptentive-android/blob/new_docs/docs/Features.md#message-center) is a
self contained Activity that you can launch with [Apptentive.showMessageCenter(Activity activity)](http://www.apptentive.com/docs/android/api/com/apptentive/android/sdk/Apptentive.html#showMessageCenter%28android.app.Activity%29).

You should find a place in your app where you can create a link or button that opens your **Message Center**.

###### Example

Here is how you can show **Message Center** by hooking it up to a button in your app.

```java
Button messageCenterButton = (Button)findViewById(R.id.your_message_center_button);
messageCenterButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener(){
    public void onClick(View v) {
        Apptentive.showMessageCenter(YourActivity.this);
    }
});
```

### Send Custom Data With a Message (Optional)

Additionally, you can supply custom key/value pairs that will be sent in the next message that the customer sends while
**Message Center** is open. For instance, if you have a dining app, you could pass in a key of `restaurant` and value of
`Joe's Pizza`. If the customer sends a more than one message, only the first message will include this custom data. If
you wish to add more custom data to another subsequent message, you will need to call this method with custom data again.

###### Example

```java
    Map<String, String> customData = new HashMap<String, String>();
    customData.put("restaurant", "Joe's Pizza");
    Apptentive.showMessageCenter(YourActivity.this, customData);
```

### New Message Notification (Optional)

If you would like to be notified when a new message is sent to the client, register a listener using [Apptentive.setUnreadMessageListener(UnreadMessageListener listener)](http://www.apptentive.com/docs/android/api/com/apptentive/android/sdk/Apptentive.html#setUnreadMessagesListener%28com.apptentive.android.sdk.module.messagecenter.UnreadMessagesListener%29).
When the number of unread messages changes, either because your customer read a message, or a new message came in, [onUnreadMessageCountChanged(int unreadMessages)](http://www.apptentive.com/docs/android/api/com/apptentive/android/sdk/module/messagecenter/UnreadMessagesListener.html#onUnreadMessageCountChanged%28int%29)
will be called. Because this listener could be called at any time, you should store the value returned from this method,
and then perform any user interaction you desire at the appropriate time.

###### Example

```java
Apptentive.setUnreadMessagesListener(
    new UnreadMessagesListener() {
        public void onUnreadMessageCountChanged(final int unreadMessages) {
            // Use the updated count.
        }
    }
);
```

# Adding Events

You should add a handful of [Events](https://github.com/skykelsey/apptentive-android/blob/new_docs/docs/Features.md#events)
to your app when you integrate. Since **Events** are both records of an action within your app being performed, and an
opportunity to show an [Interaction](https://github.com/skykelsey/apptentive-android/blob/new_docs/docs/Features.md#interactions),
you should choose places within your app that would be appropriate to interact with your customer, as well as places
where a significant event has occured. The more **Events** you add during integration, the more you will learn about
your customers, and the more fine tuned your communications with them can be. Here is a list of potential places to add
**Events**.

Places where you might want to show an **Interaction**:
* Main Activity gains focus
* Settings Activity gains focus
* Customer performs an action that indicates they are confused
* There is a natural pause in the app's UI where starting a conversation would not offend the customer

Places where you might want to record a significant event:
* Customer makes a purchase
* Customer declines to make a purchase
* Customer beats a level
* Customer performs an action that indicates they know how to use your app
* Customer performs an action that indicates they are confused
* Your app crashes

As you can see, there is some overlap in whether you want to just record an **Event**, or also show an **Interaction**.

To add an **Event** and possibly show an **Interaction**, simply call [Apptentive.engage(Activity activity, String eventName)](http://www.apptentive.com/docs/android/api/com/apptentive/android/sdk/Apptentive.html#engage%28android.app.Activity,%20java.lang.String%29)
with an `eventName` of your choosing.

###### Example

Add an **Event** when your app's main Activity comes up.

```java
@Override
public void onWindowFocusChanged(boolean hasFocus) {
    super.onWindowFocusChanged(hasFocus);
    if (hasFocus) {
        // Engage a code point called "init".
        boolean shown = Apptentive.engage(this, "main_activity_focused");
    }
}
```

**Note:** Each **Event** should have a unique name.


# Configure Interactions

Once you have configured your app to use several **Events**, you can configure **Interactions** on [apptentive.com](https://be.apptentive.com)

#### Ratings Prompt

To set up the [Ratings Prompt](https://github.com/skykelsey/apptentive-android/blob/new_docs/docs/Features.md#ratings-prompt)
**Interaction**, first make sure you have created some [Events](#adding-events) in your app. Then, go to
*Interactions -> Ratings Prompt*. There, you will be able to customize the text and behavior of the dialogs that make up
the **Ratings Prompt**, and configure the logic that will determine when it will be shown. You will also need to pick
where the **Ratings Prompt** will be shownn, by choosing an **Event** from the dropdown.

#### Surveys

[Surveys](https://github.com/skykelsey/apptentive-android/blob/new_docs/docs/Features.md#surveys) can also be configured
from the server. First, make sure you have created some [Events](#adding-events), then go to *Interactions -> Surveys*.
Create a new survey. You can give it a title and description, then add questions, and finally set targeting and limiting
constraints so it's shown to the right people. After your survey is live, you will start to see results in the *Surveys*
page.

**Note:** If you were using surveys prior to version 1.5.0 of the Apptentive Android SDK, see this Migration Guide for
instructions.

#### Upgrade Messages

When you release a new version of your app, you should create an [Upgrade Message](https://github.com/skykelsey/apptentive-android/blob/new_docs/docs/Features.md#upgrade-messages)
to tell your customers what's new. To do so, go to *Interactions -> Upgrade Messages*. You can use the editor to write
out details about this release, and then target the message to display when a customer upgrades your app to a specific
[version name or code](http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/versioning.html).

**Note**: **Upgrade Messages** are always targeted to the special `init` **Event**. You should trigger `init` at
the first opportunity when your app starts up by calling `Apptentive.engage(this, "init")`.

**Note**: **Upgrade Messages** are only shown if the app is upgrading from a previous version. If you are installing a
version of your app that has an **Upgrade Message** targeted to it, but it is not upgradeing from a previous version,
the **Upgrade Message** will not be shown.

# Push Notifications

**Apptentive** can send [push notifications](https://github.com/skykelsey/apptentive-android/blob/new_docs/docs/Features.md#push-notifications)
to your app when you reply to your customers. Your replies are more likely to be seen by your customer when you do this.
To set up push notifications, you will need to enter your push credentials on [apptentive.com](https://be.apptentive.com),
send us the id that your push provider uses to identify the device, and call into our SDK when you receive and open a
push notification.

### Supported Push Providers

* Urban Airship
* Amazom Web Services SNS

### Configuring Your Push Credentials

To enter your push credentials, go to [apptentive.com](https://be.apptentive.com), select *Settings -> Integrations*,
choose either *Urban Airship* or *Amazon Web Services SNS*, and follow the instructions on that page.

### Setting the Device Token

In order for **Apptentive** to send push notifications to the correct device, you will need to pass us the device
identifier for the push provider you are using.

#### Setting the Urban Airship APID

The Urban Airship device ID is called *APID* (Airship Push ID). You can retreive it in one of two ways:

1. If you set up Urban Airship using a BroadcastReceiver to listen to Intents that Urban Airship sends you, you can
retreive the APID by listening for the Intent with action [PushManager.ACTION_REGISTRATION_FINISHED](http://docs.urbanairship.com/reference/libraries/android/latest/reference/com/urbanairship/push/PushManager.html#ACTION_REGISTRATION_FINISHED),
grabbing the extra data [PushManager.EXTRA_APID](http://docs.urbanairship.com/reference/libraries/android/latest/reference/com/urbanairship/push/PushManager.html#EXTRA_APID),
and passing it to [Apptentive.addUrbanAirshipPushIntegration(Context context, String apid](http://www.apptentive.com/docs/android/api/index.html?com/apptentive/android/sdk/ApptentiveActivity.html).

    ###### Example

    ```java
    String apid = intent.getStringExtra(PushManager.EXTRA_APID);
    Apptentive.addUrbanAirshipPushIntegration(context, apid);
    ```

    This method is preferable, because you will get the APID at the earliest possible time after the app is registered with
    UA, and will only need to give it to the Apptentive SDK once.

2. If you are not using a broadcast receiver, you can call [PushManager.getAPID()](http://docs.urbanairship.com/reference/libraries/android/latest/reference/com/urbanairship/push/PushManager.html#getAPID%28%29).
This method may return null if Urban Airship hasn't finished registering, so don't give it to us until it returns an
actual apid.

    ###### Example

    ```java
    String apid = PushManager.getAPID();
    if (apid != null) {
    Apptentive.addUrbanAirshipPushIntegration(context, apid);
    }
    ```

#### Setting the Amazon Web Services SNS Registration ID

Amazzon Web Services SNS uses GCM directly on the client, so you will need to use the GCM API to retreive the
Registration ID. See the [GCM documentation](http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/client.html) if you are unsure how
to retreive your Registration ID. When you have the Registration ID, pass it to [Apptentive.addAmazonSnsPushIntegration(Context context, String registrationId)](http://www.apptentive.com/docs/android/api/com/apptentive/android/sdk/Apptentive.html#addAmazonSnsPushIntegration%28android.content.Context,%20java.lang.String%29).

###### Example

```java
String registrationId;
Apptentive.addAmazonSnsPushIntegration(this, registrationId);
```

#### Displaying the Push Notification

Opening an Apptentive push notification involves three easy steps: When the push notification is tapped by your customer,
pass it to [Apptentive.setPendingPushNotification(Context context, Intent intent)](http://www.apptentive.com/docs/android/api/com/apptentive/android/sdk/Apptentive.html#setPendingPushNotification%28android.content.Context,%20android.content.Intent%29),
launch your main Activity, and display the push notification with [Apptentive.handleOpenedPushNotification(Activity activity)](http://www.apptentive.com/docs/android/api/com/apptentive/android/sdk/Apptentive.html#handleOpenedPushNotification%28android.app.Activity%29).
This two pass approach is necessary to avoid double displaying the push notification. Both of these methods do nothing
if the push notification didn't come from Apptentive.

###### Example

Push notification opened.

```java
Apptentive.setPendingPushNotification(context, intent);
// Then launch your main Activity.
```



In your main Activity, handle the push notification.

```java
@Override
public void onWindowFocusChanged(boolean hasFocus) {
  super.onWindowFocusChanged(hasFocus);
  if (hasFocus) {
    boolean ranApptentive = Apptentive.handleOpenedPushNotification(this);
    if (ranApptentive) {
      // Don't try to take any action here. Wait until the customer closes our UI.
      return;
    }
  }
}
```

# Set Customer Email address

If you already know the customer's email address, you can pass it to us during initialization. Simple call [Apptentive.setInitialUserEmail(Context context, String email)](http://www.apptentive.com/docs/android/api/com/apptentive/android/sdk/Apptentive.html#setInitialUserEmail%28android.content.Context,%20java.lang.String%29).

# Custom Data

You can send [Custom Data](https://github.com/skykelsey/apptentive-android/blob/new_docs/docs/Features.md#custom-data)
associated with either the device, or the person using the app. This is useful for sending
user IDs and other information that helps you support your users better. **Custom Data** can also be used for
configuring when [Interactions](https://github.com/skykelsey/apptentive-android/blob/new_docs/docs/Features.md#interactions)
will run. For best results, call this during `onCreate()`.

###### Example

Send the user ID of your customer.

```java
Apptentive.addCustomPersonData(this, "1234567890");
```

# Attachments

You can send [hidden messages and attachments](https://github.com/skykelsey/apptentive-android/blob/new_docs/docs/Features.md#sending-hidden-messages-and-attachments) to Apptentoive that will show up in your customer conversation view on [apptentive.com](https://be.apptentive.com),
but are not shown to your customer.

###### Example

```java
// Send a file.
InputStream is = new FileInputStream("filePath");
Apptentive.sendAttachmentFile(this, is);

// Send a text message.
Apptentive.sendAttachmentText(this, "Message to display in the conversation view.");
```

# Setting Rating Provider

If you host your app in an app store other than Google Play, you will need to make sure customers who want to rate your
app will be able to do so. To choose which app store the **Ratings Prompt Interaction** will take you to, we've built
several **Rating Providers**. A **Rating Provider** is an implementation of the [IRatingProvider](http://www.apptentive.com/docs/android/api/com/apptentive/android/sdk/module/rating/IRatingProvider.html)
interface, and its job is to provide a simple interface to open the app store. To use another supported [rating provider](https://github.com/skykelsey/apptentive-android/blob/new_docs/docs/Features.md#setting-rating-provider),
you can make a call to [Apptentive.setRatingProvider(IRatingProvider ratingProvider)](http://www.apptentive.com/docs/android/api/com/apptentive/android/sdk/Apptentive.html#setRatingProvider%28com.apptentive.android.sdk.module.rating.IRatingProvider%29).
If you would like to use an app store that we don't yet support, you can implement the [IRatingProvider](http://www.apptentive.com/docs/android/api/com/apptentive/android/sdk/module/rating/IRatingProvider.html)
interface, and pass your implementation to `setRatingProvider()`.

#### Supported Rating Providers

* [Google Play](http://www.apptentive.com/docs/android/api/com/apptentive/android/sdk/module/rating/impl/GooglePlayRatingProvider.html)
* [Amazon Appstore](http://www.apptentive.com/docs/android/api/com/apptentive/android/sdk/module/rating/impl/AmazonAppstoreRatingProvider.html)

###### Using the Amazon Appstore Rating Provider

```java
Apptentive.setRatingProvider(new AmaonAppstoreRatingProvider);
```
